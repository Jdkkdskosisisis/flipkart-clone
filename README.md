# flipkart-clone

Introduction:

In this report, I will be discussing the development of a Flipkart clone website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap specifically for desktop devices. The website will be a replica of the original Flipkart website with some modifications. The purpose of this project is to provide an opportunity to practice and showcase skills in web development for desktop devices.

Website Design:

The design of the Flipkart clone website for desktop devices is similar to the original Flipkart website. The homepage contains a search bar, navigation menu, banner slider, and product categories. The product categories are displayed in a grid view with images, titles, and prices. Each category has a "View More" button that redirects to the respective category page.

The category page displays products in the same grid view as the homepage. Each product has an image, title, and price. The product image is clickable, which redirects to the product detail page. The product detail page displays product images, title, price, description, and specifications. The page also contains a "Buy Now" button that redirects to the checkout page.

The checkout page contains a form for the user to fill in their personal and payment details. The form includes fields such as name, address, phone number, email, and payment method. The page also displays the order summary with product details and total amount.

Technologies Used:

The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap specifically for desktop devices. HTML is used to structure the content and create the web pages. CSS is used to style the web pages and make them visually appealing. Bootstrap is used to make the website responsive and mobile-friendly.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the development of the Flipkart clone website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap specifically for desktop devices was a great opportunity to practice and showcase web development skills. The website is a replica of the original Flipkart website with some modifications. The website is responsive and mobile-friendly, making it accessible to users on different devices, but it has been optimized specifically for desktop devices to provide the best user experience.
